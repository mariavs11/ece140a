##Lab4
###Tutorial 1
We learned how to install my SQL and all the steps necessary to create a table (create.sql), insert data into tables (insert.sql), delete rows (delete.sql), select from the tables (select.sql) 
and to update the tables (update.sql).

###Tutorial 2
For this tutorial, we learned how to create my SQL tables and insert data from CSV files into our tables.


Q: In your README, please include a short description of what each of these data types 
and their input values represent. 

A: The data type int is for integers, var char is for characters and their input value limits the number of characters, 
decimal is for decimals and the first input is the total number of digits in the value and the second input is the total number of decimal places.

###Tutorial 3
For this tutorial, we learned basic queries with SQL to query data from the tables we created.

###Challenge 1
We wrote queries to query data from the database Lab4_songs, according to what was asked in the questions.
I used w3schools.com as a resource to write the queries and achieve the expected outcomes.

###Challenge 2 
We created a database called Challenge2 that took data from csv files and inserted to their corresponding tables.
We were, then, asked to query the database and to modify the tables.
