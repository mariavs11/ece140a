### Name: Maria Vieira Santos   A15616273
#### Tutorial 1

In this tutorial, I learned how to implement a clock and a slider with Javascript and HTML. 
The tutorial also taught us how to check for an event in the webpage using addEventListener() and also how to update the page everytime an interval of time has passed using setInterval().
#### Tutorial 2

In this tutorial, I learned how to navigate web APIs: how to get your API key and how to use it to retrieve important information from a JSON Object

### CHALLENGE 1
For this challenge, we were asked to create a codepen Project with slider using Javascript and HTML. The slider was labeled with 5 different cities at different time zones.  
When I move the slider to a different city, the current time at that city appears on the screen. 
My only additional feature was AM/PM implementation.

### CHALLENGE 2
For this challenge, we were asked to use the Financial Modeling Prep API from the tutorial to get information on a given stock onto my web page. 
I used Demo 3, introduced in the Javascript Tutorial, to complete this challenge. 

The webpage gets an input from the user (using a Submit button) and then we fetch the data from the API page for the specific input.
